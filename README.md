*About

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems. I have categorized the solutions based on different topics and difficulty levels to make it easier for others to navigate and find relevant problems. By sharing my solutions, I hope to provide a helpful resource for fellow programmers and aspiring interviewees who are looking for coding practice and guidance.

*Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference for your own learning and problem-solving. You can browse through the folders to find problems related to specific topics or search for problems using the provided titles. Each problem solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation and code implementation in a programming language of my choice (usually Python).

To make the most out of this repository, you can follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the relevant folder/topic you're interested in.
Open the problem's solution file and study the code and explanation.
Experiment with the code, modify it, and run it to deepen your understanding.
Repeat the process for other problems or explore additional topics.

*Solutions

The repository includes solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, covering various data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts. The solutions are organized into folders based on different topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more. Within each topic, you will find subfolders for different difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard.

Each problem's solution folder typically contains the following:

README.md: Provides a detailed explanation of the problem statement, approach, and algorithm used.
Solution file(s): Contains the code implementation in a specific programming language.
Test cases: Examples or test cases to validate the solution.

*Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute your own solutions or suggest improvements to existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the established format and guidelines for adding new solutions, and provide clear explanations and code implementations.
